I am currently a PhD student at [MIT DSG](http://dsg.csail.mit.edu/) working with
[Prof. Sam Madden](http://db.csail.mit.edu/madden/). Before joining MIT, I worked with
[the infamous Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/) at
[the CMU terrier club](https://noisepage.com/people/), where I received my bachelor's and master's degree
in computer science.
